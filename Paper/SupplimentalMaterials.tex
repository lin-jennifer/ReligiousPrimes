\section*{Argument Conditions}

\subsection*{Conservative}

The US needs to reduce the number of women having abortions! The Government should stop supporting abortion providers like Planned Parenthood and should make abortion illegal

Here are the reasons why:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fetuses in the womb are unborn children – they feel pain and have the right to live
	\item	Women who have abortions often suffer physical consequences and mental anguish
	\item	It is unethical to use tax dollars to support abortion providers because so many Americans believe abortion is immoral
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Liberal}

The US needs to ensure women have access to safe abortions! The Government should increase funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood and should end abortion restrictions.

Here are the reasons why:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  The government should not control women’s bodies – forcing women to bear children against their will makes them second-class citizens
	\item Making abortions illegal will result in women seeking out unsafe abortions, which are dangerous and sometimes result in death
	\item It is unfair that many women who need abortions cannot afford them. The government should find a way to reduce the cost of abortions for low-income women.
\end{enumerate}
